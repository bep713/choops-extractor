To override an entire IFF:
 - Place the .iff directly in the _overrides folder

 - *Note* if there is a .iff present in the _overrides folder, it will take precedence and none of the below subfile edits will take effect for that particular iff.*



To override an entire subfile:
 - Place the subfile in the _overrides/[iff name] folder with the correct extension.



To override a TXTR file with a DDS:
 - Place the DDS in the _overrides/[iff name]/[subfile name] folder with filename: [subfile name without extension].dds

 - *Note* if there is a .txtr present in the _overrides/[iff name] folder, the DDS will be ignored.



To override a texture inside a SCNE:
 - Place the DDS in the _overrides/[iff name]/[subfile name] folder. Filename: texture_[texture index].dds

 - *Note* SCNE texture overrides are additive. If there is a .scne present in the _overrides/[iff file] folder, the textures will be merged into that SCNE file. (The file will not be altered in the filesystem, only in game)
